# hello-world
Hello guys. It's nice to meet you.

I'm Daniela. I like reading various books and imagining things like from Sci-fi movies.
I'm not english native speaker so if my english is bad don't worry, be happy :) My native language is polish.
So maybe I'll write more about me in future, but for now it's all.

Pa pa! (It's something like bye bye in polish)
